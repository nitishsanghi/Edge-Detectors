# Edge Detection Library

The Edge Detection Library is a versatile C++ toolkit designed to facilitate the detection of edges in images. Leveraging the power of Eigen for matrix operations and OpenCV for comprehensive image processing, this library currently supports a suite of Sobel edge detection methods. It's built with extensibility in mind, making it an ideal starting point for implementing and experimenting with various edge detection algorithms.

## Features

- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Implements Sobel edge detection in the X direction, Y direction, and combined XY directions.
- **Future-Proof**: Architecturally designed to support additional edge detection algorithms.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Eigen for efficient matrix computations, ensuring high performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Offers a straightforward API for loading, processing, and saving images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- CMake (Version 3.14 or newer)
- OpenCV (Version 4.0 or newer)
- Eigen (Version 3.3 or newer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EdgeDetectionLibrary.git
   cd EdgeDetectionLibrary
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   Use CMake to build the project:

   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

### Quick Start

To get up and running with the Edge Detection Library, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Instance of `EdgeDetector`**

   ```cpp
   #include "edge_detector.hpp"

   EdgeDetector detector;
   ```

2. **Load an Image**

   ```cpp
   detector.loadImage("path/to/your/image.png");
   ```

3. **Apply Edge Detection**

   ```cpp
   auto edges = detector.applyDetector(EdgeDetector::DetectorType::SOBEL);
   ```

4. **Save the Detected Edges**

   ```cpp
   detector.saveEdgeImage("path/to/save/edges.png", edges);
   ```
