# Edge Detection Library

The Edge Detection Library is a versatile C++ toolkit designed to facilitate the detection of edges in images. Leveraging the power of Eigen for matrix operations and OpenCV for comprehensive image processing, this library currently supports a suite of Sobel edge detection methods. It's built with extensibility in mind, making it an ideal starting point for implementing and experimenting with various edge detection algorithms.

## Features

- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Implements Sobel edge detection in the X direction, Y direction, and combined XY directions.
- **Future-Proof**: Architecturally designed to support additional edge detection algorithms.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Eigen for efficient matrix computations, ensuring high performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Offers a straightforward API for loading, processing, and saving images.
